Founded in 1900, College Board was created to expand access to higher education. Today, the membership association is made up of over 6,000 of the world's leading education institutions and is dedicated to promoting excellence and equity in education. Each year, College Board helps more than seven million students prepare for a successful transition to college through programs and services in college readiness and college success—including the SAT® and the Advanced Placement® Program. The organization also serves the education community through research and advocacy on behalf of students, educators, and schools.\n\nFor further information, visit **[collegeboard.org](www.collegeboard.org)**.\n\n## **ACCUPLACER Advanced Algebra and Functions Sample Questions**\n\nThe Advanced Algebra and Functions placement test is a computer adaptive assessment of test takers' ability for selected mathematics content. Questions will focus on a range of topics, including a variety of equations and functions, including linear, quadratic, rational, radical, polynomial, and exponential. Questions will also delve into some geometry and trigonometry concepts. In addition, questions may assess a student's math ability via computational or fluency skills, conceptual understanding, or the capacity to apply mathematics presented in a context. All questions are multiple choice in format and appear discretely (stand alone) across the assessment. The following knowledge and skill categories are assessed:\n\n- Linear equations\n- Linear applications\n- Factoring\n- Quadratics\n- Functions\n- Radical and rational equations\n- Polynomial equations\n- Exponential and logarithmic equations\n- Geometry concepts\n- Trigonometry\n\n© 2020 College Board.

Output Format:\n     • Return the result as a JSON array of strings, where each string is one LaTeX-formatted equation.\n     • If no equations are found, return an empty list: [].\n\nContext:\n  • The input is a Markdown chunk converted from a PDF page, so it may include headings, lists, and inline formatting.\n  • Focus solely on equations; do NOT include any explanatory text or observations in the output.\n\nMarkdown Input:\n\n{chunk_md}\n\nJSON Output:\n'''","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-26T10:57:48.230155Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-26T10:57:48.230429Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-26T10:57:48.235103Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-26T10:57:48.230409Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-26T10:57:48.234369Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":"results = []\nfor idx, block in enumerate(chunks, start=1):\n    prompt = make_prompt(block['markdown'])\n    output = eq_extractor(prompt)[0]['generated_text']\n    try:\n        json_start = output.index('[')\n        equations = json.loads(output[json_start:])\n    except Exception:\n        equations = []\n    results.append({\n        'chunk_id': idx,\n        'page': block['page'],\n        'equations': equations\n    })","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-26T10:57:50.967912Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-26T10:57:50.968181Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-26T11:02:45.699580Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-26T10:57:50.968162Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-26T11:02:45.699054Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length.
